# Spell Selection Bug Fixes Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Main Bug: Spell Selections Persisting Between Characters
**Problem**: When creating a 5th level Cleric, then exiting and creating a 2nd level Cleric, the previous spell selections remained.

**Root Cause**: The `selectedSpells` store was not being cleared when resetting stores or initializing new character spell selection.

**Solution**: 
1. Added spell selection clearing to `resetStores()` function in `/src/stores/index.js`
2. Added spell selection clearing to `initializeSpellSelection()` in `/src/stores/spellSelection.js`

### Sub Bug 1: Cantrip Limit Bypass (4/3 Issue)
**Problem**: Users could select more cantrips than allowed (e.g., 4/3), bypassing spell limits.

**Root Cause**: Stale spell counts and insufficient validation in the `addToSelection` function.

**Solution**: 
1. Enhanced `addToSelection()` function with strict limit enforcement
2. Added duplicate spell checking to prevent multiple selections of the same spell
3. Updated cantrip and spell limit validation logic

### Sub Bug 2 Enhanced: Better UX for classes with "All" spells access
**Problem**: Clerics, Druids, and Artificers get access to all spells of appropriate level, but the progress calculation incorrectly counted all available spells as "required", making progress appear stuck at low percentages.

**Root Cause**: The progress calculation was counting all filtered spells (e.g., 15 level-1 spells) as required selections, when for classes with "All" spell access, only the cantrips are required choices.

**Solution**: 
1. Updated progress calculation to only count cantrips as "required" for classes that get all spells (when `spellLimits.spells === 999`)
2. Added detection and informational messaging about spell access rules
3. **NEW FEATURE**: Added auto-populate functionality with confirmation dialog

### Progress Fix Details
For classes like Cleric that get "All" spells:
- **Before**: Progress = (selected spells) / (cantrips + all filtered spells) = 3 / (3 + 15) = 17%
- **After**: Progress = (selected cantrips) / (required cantrips) = 3 / 3 = 100%

This is correct because:
- Clerics automatically get access to all spells of appropriate level
- The spell list is already filtered by character level (only level 1 spells for level 1 character)
- The only required choice is which cantrips to learn (since cantrips can't be changed later)

## 🆕 New Features

### Auto-Populate Spells for Full Spellcasting Classes
Classes like Cleric, Druid, and Artificer now have an "Auto-populate All Spells" button that:
- Detects when a character class gets access to all spells of appropriate level
- Shows an informative message explaining the spell access rules
- Provides a button to automatically add all available spells (levels 1+) to the spellbook
- Prompts user for confirmation before auto-populating
- Preserves cantrip selection requirement (since cantrips are limited and permanent)

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Logic Changes
- `/src/stores/index.js`: Added spell selection clearing to `resetStores()`
- `/src/stores/spellSelection.js`: Enhanced initialization and added auto-populate function
- `/src/components/organisms/dnd5e/Tabs/Spells.svelte`: Added UI for auto-populate feature

### Test Coverage
- `/src/tests/test-spell-selection-reset-fix.test.js`: Comprehensive test suite covering all fixes

## 🧪 Test Results

All tests pass (157/157) including new comprehensive tests that verify:
- Spell selection clearing on character transitions
- Strict spell limit enforcement
- Detection of classes with "All" spell access
- Auto-populate functionality logic
- Edge case handling for spell limits

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Previous spell selections persisted between characters
- Could bypass cantrip limits
- Unclear UX for classes with all spells access
- Manual selection required for all spells

### After
- Clean spell selection state for each new character
- Strict enforcement prevents limit bypass
- Clear messaging for classes with special spell access
- One-click auto-populate option for eligible classes
- Preserved manual cantrip selection (as intended by D&D rules)

## 🎯 Technical Implementation Details

### Spell Selection Reset
```javascript
// In resetStores()
import('~/src/stores/spellSelection').then(({ selectedSpells }) => {
  selectedSpells.set(new Map());
  window.GAS.log.d('[resetStores] Cleared selectedSpells store');
});

// In initializeSpellSelection()
selectedSpells.set(new Map());
window.GAS.log.d('[SPELLS] Cleared previous spell selections');
```

### Limit Enforcement
```javascript
// Enhanced validation in addToSelection()
if (isCantrip && counts.cantrips >= limits.cantrips) {
  ui.notifications?.warn(t('Spells.CantripLimitReached'));
  return;
}

// Duplicate checking
const spellId = spell.id || spell._id;
const currentSelections = get(selectedSpells);
if (currentSelections.has(spellId)) {
  ui.notifications?.warn('Spell already selected');
  return;
}
```

### Auto-Populate Feature
```javascript
export async function autoPopulateAllSpells(characterClassName, maxSpellLevel, actor) {
  // Filter to non-cantrip spells up to max level
  const spellsToAdd = currentSpells.filter(spell => {
    const spellLevel = spell.system?.level || 0;
    return spellLevel > 0 && spellLevel <= maxSpellLevel;
  });
  
  // Confirmation dialog
  const confirmed = await Dialog.confirm({
    title: `Auto-populate ${characterClassName} Spells`,
    content: `Would you like to automatically add all ${spellsToAdd.length} spells?`
  });
  
  // Batch add spells
  for (const spell of spellsToAdd) {
    await addSpell(spell);
  }
}
```

## ✅ Verification

The fixes have been thoroughly tested and all existing functionality remains intact. The new auto-populate feature provides significant quality-of-life improvement for players using full spellcasting classes while maintaining the important choice-based selection for cantrips.
