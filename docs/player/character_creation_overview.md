# Character Creation Overview (Player)

Welcome to Actor Studio! This tool guides you through creating your dnd5e character step-by-step.

## Launching Actor Studio

Your GM needs to grant you permission to create actors first. Once you have permission, you can usually start Actor Studio by:

1.  Going to the "Actors" sidebar tab (icon looks like a person).
2.  Clicking the "Create Actor" button.
3.  Choosing the "Actor Studio" option (or similar) presented.

Alternatively, your GM might point you to a specific button added by Actor Studio elsewhere in the interface.

## The Workflow: Tabs and Previews

Actor Studio presents character creation as a series of tabs:

1.  **Ability Scores:** Set your character's core stats.
2.  **Race:** Choose your character's race.
3.  **Background:** Select a background.
4.  **Class & Subclass:** Pick your starting class and potentially a subclass.
5.  **Advancements:** Preview the features and choices you'll get from your selections.

-   **Navigate:** Work through the tabs sequentially using the navigation buttons or by clicking the tab headers.
-   **Make Selections:** Click on the options presented in each tab (e.g., click on a race name, choose an ability score method).
-   **Preview:** As you make choices, the interface often updates to show you the immediate effects (e.g., ability score changes based on race). You can freely go back and change previous selections to explore different combinations.

## Creating the Character

Once you have made selections in all the main tabs and are happy with your choices:

1.  **Click "Create Character":** Find and click the button labeled "Create Character" (or similar).
2.  **Actor Generation:** Actor Studio will create a new Actor sheet for your character in the Actors sidebar.
3.  **Advancement Prompts:** Immediately after the actor is created, the dnd5e system's Advancement prompts will appear. You **must** complete these to make choices granted by your race, class, and background (like skill proficiencies, languages, tool proficiencies, etc.). Follow the prompts carefully.
4.  **Starting Equipment/Gold:** After Advancements are done, you might be prompted to choose starting equipment or take starting gold, depending on your class and background choices and the GM's configuration.

Your basic character is now ready! You can open the character sheet from the Actors sidebar.
