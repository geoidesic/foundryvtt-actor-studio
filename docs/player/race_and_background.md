# Race & Background (Player)

After setting ability scores, you'll choose your character's Race and Background.

## Race Tab

This tab allows you to select your character's race or lineage.

1.  **Browse:** A list of available races (from the compendiums your GM enabled) will be displayed.
2.  **Preview:** Click on a race name. Actor Studio will typically show:
    -   A description of the race.
    -   Racial traits (like speed, darkvision, special abilities).
    -   Ability score modifiers provided by the race.
    -   Any subraces available (you might select these here or they might appear as separate race entries).
3.  **Select:** Once you've decided, ensure the desired race (and subrace, if applicable) is selected. The interface should indicate your current choice.

Your chosen race's traits and ability score modifiers will be automatically applied to your character sheet after creation and factored into the Advancement prompts.

This tab allows you to select your character's background, representing their life before adventuring.

1.  **Browse:** A list of available backgrounds (from the compendiums your GM enabled) will be displayed.
2.  **Preview:** Click on a background name. Actor Studio will typically show:
    -   A description of the background.
    -   Skill proficiencies granted.
    -   Tool proficiencies or languages granted.
    -   Starting equipment associated with the background.
    -   The background feature (a special roleplaying benefit).
3.  **Select:** Click to confirm your choice of background.

The benefits of your chosen background (skills, tools, languages, equipment, feature) will be applied during character creation, often via the Advancement prompts.
