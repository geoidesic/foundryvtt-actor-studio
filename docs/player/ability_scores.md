# Ability Scores (Player)

The first step in creating your character is determining their Ability Scores: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha).

Actor Studio provides several methods for this in the "Ability Scores" tab:

## Methods

1.  **Standard Array:**
    -   **How it works:** You get a fixed set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) to assign to your abilities.
    -   **Usage:** Click and drag (or use dropdowns/buttons, depending on the interface) to assign each score to one ability. Each score must be used exactly once.

2.  **Point Buy:**
    -   **How it works:** You start with a pool of points (typically 27) and "buy" scores for your abilities. Higher scores cost more points. All scores start at 8.
    -   **Usage:** Use "+" and "-" buttons (or similar controls) next to each ability score to increase or decrease it. The interface will show the point cost for each increase and the remaining points in your pool. You cannot exceed the point limit or raise scores above a certain maximum (usually 15 before racial modifiers).

3.  **Manual Entry:**
    -   **How it works:** You directly type the desired score into the field for each ability.
    -   **Usage:** Click into the input box for each ability score and type the number. This method is often used if your GM has allowed you to use pre-rolled scores.

4.  **Dice Rolls (e.g., 4d6 drop lowest):**
    -   **How it works:** The tool simulates rolling dice (commonly rolling four 6-sided dice and summing the highest three) six times to generate six scores.
    -   **Usage:** Click a "Roll" button. Actor Studio will display the six generated scores. You then assign these rolled scores to your abilities, similar to the Standard Array method. Some versions might allow re-rolling if the GM permits.

## Racial Modifiers

Note that the scores you set here are your *base* scores. Racial modifiers (e.g., +2 Strength, +1 Charisma) will be applied automatically *after* you select your race in the next tab. Actor Studio might show a preview of the final scores including potential racial modifiers as you select a race.

Choose the method approved by your GM and set your base ability scores.
