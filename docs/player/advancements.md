# Advancements (Player)

The "Advancements" tab provides a preview of the choices and features you will gain based on your Race, Background, and Class selections. It also represents the process you'll go through *after* clicking "Create Character".

## Previewing Advancements

While using Actor Studio *before* creating the character:

-   **Purpose:** This tab lists the features, proficiencies, and choices granted by your selections across different levels.
-   **Usage:** You can often filter or browse by level to see what your character will gain as they level up. This helps you understand the progression of your chosen class and subclass.
-   **No Choices Here (Yet):** You generally do not make your actual advancement choices (like selecting specific skills or languages) in this preview tab. This tab is for informational purposes during the initial build planning.

## The Advancement Workflow (After Creation)

This is the critical step that happens *after* you click "Create Character".

1.  **Prompts Appear:** Foundry VTT's Advancement system will automatically present you with a series of prompts or dialog boxes.
2.  **Making Choices:** Each prompt will ask you to make a specific choice granted by your race, background, or class at level 1. Examples include:
    -   Choosing skill proficiencies (e.g., "Choose 2 skills from Acrobatics, Animal Handling...")
    -   Choosing tool proficiencies (e.g., "Choose one type of artisan's tools")
    -   Choosing languages (e.g., "Choose one standard language")
    -   Making specific feature choices (e.g., Fighting Style for a Fighter, Metamagic for a Sorcerer at later levels).
3.  **Follow Instructions:** Read each prompt carefully and make your selections.
4.  **Completion:** Continue through all prompts until the Advancement process is complete for your starting level.

**Important:** Your GM must have the dnd5e system setting "Disable Level Up Automation" **unchecked** for this process to work correctly. If Advancements do not trigger, notify your GM.

Completing the Advancements correctly ensures your character receives all the features and benefits they are entitled to at their starting level.
