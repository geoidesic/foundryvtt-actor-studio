# Class & Subclass (Player)

This tab is where you choose your character's starting Class and, if applicable at level 1 or if previewing higher levels, your Subclass.

## Class Selection

1.  **Browse:** A list of available classes (from the compendiums your GM enabled) will be displayed.
2.  **Preview:** Click on a class name. Actor Studio will show details like:
    -   Class description.
    -   Hit Dice.
    -   Primary Abilities.
    -   Saving Throw proficiencies.
    -   Armor and Weapon proficiencies.
    -   Starting skill proficiency choices.
    -   Starting equipment choices.
    -   Level 1 class features.
    -   Information about when a subclass is chosen (e.g., "at 1st level", "at 3rd level").
3.  **Select:** Click to confirm your choice of starting class.

## Subclass Selection

-   **Availability:** Subclasses (e.g., Path of the Berserker for Barbarian, School of Evocation for Wizard) are typically chosen at levels 1, 2, or 3, depending on the class.
-   **Selection:** If your chosen class selects its subclass at level 1, a list of available subclasses will appear after you select the class.
    -   Browse and preview subclass features similarly to how you previewed class features.
    -   Click to select your desired subclass.
-   **Later Subclasses:** If your subclass is chosen at a later level (e.g., level 3), you won't select it during initial character creation at level 1. However, the Advancements tab might still allow you to *preview* subclass features for future levels. Subclass selection itself will happen during the level-up process.
-   **dnd5e System Version:** Actor Studio supports subclass selection and advancement integration for both dnd5e system v3.x (backporting some functionality) and v4.x.

Your chosen class determines many of your character's core capabilities. The features, proficiencies, and choices associated with your class and subclass will be applied during character creation, often via the Advancement prompts.
