# Starting Equipment (Player)

After completing the Advancement choices for your level 1 character, the final step is often determining your starting equipment and gold.

## How it Works

The way starting equipment is handled can depend on your Class, Background, and potentially GM preferences or module settings. There are generally two approaches:

1.  **Equipment Choices:**
    -   Your Class typically offers choices between different sets of starting gear (e.g., "a martial weapon and a shield OR two martial weapons", "a scholar's pack OR an explorer's pack").
    -   Your Background also grants a specific list of starting equipment and a small amount of gold.
    -   **Prompts:** Actor Studio or the subsequent Advancement/character creation process may present you with prompts or options within the character sheet to select your equipment based on these choices. Look for buttons or sections related to "Starting Equipment".

2.  **Starting Gold:**
    -   Some GMs prefer characters to start with a lump sum of gold (determined by class, often rolled) instead of the standard equipment packages. Players then purchase their gear manually from compendiums or item lists.
    -   **Check with GM:** If you are meant to use starting gold instead of equipment packages, your GM will instruct you on how much gold you receive and how to purchase items. Actor Studio itself might have an option related to this, or it might be handled manually after creation.

## Completing the Process

-   If presented with equipment choices, make your selections carefully.
-   If using starting gold, note the amount and consult with your GM about purchasing procedures.
-   Your background equipment and gold are usually added automatically.

Once your equipment is selected or purchased, your character is fully equipped and ready for adventure!
