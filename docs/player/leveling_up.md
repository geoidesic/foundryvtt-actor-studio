# Leveling Up (Player)

Actor Studio doesn't just help create characters; it also assists with the level-up process!

## Gaining a Level

Your GM will tell you when your character has gained enough experience or reached a milestone to advance to the next level.

## Initiating the Level Up

1.  **Open Character Sheet:** Open your character sheet in Foundry VTT.
2.  **Find Level Up Button:** Look for a "Level Up" button (or similar icon/text). Its location might depend on the character sheet theme you are using (e.g., standard dnd5e sheet, Tidy5eSheet). It's often located near your character's current level or experience points.
3.  **Click the Button:** Click the "Level Up" button.

## The Level Up Workflow

Clicking the button initiates a guided process, often involving Advancements:

1.  **Class Selection:**
    -   You will typically be prompted to confirm which class you are taking a level in.
    -   **Multiclassing:** If your GM allows multiclassing, you may have the option to choose a level in a *new* class instead of your existing one. Actor Studio supports multiclassing.
2.  **HP Increase:** Your Hit Points will usually be increased automatically (either by rolling your class's Hit Die or taking the average, depending on game rules/settings).
3.  **Advancement Prompts:** Similar to character creation, the Advancement system will trigger prompts for any new features, choices, or improvements granted by the level you just gained in your chosen class. This could include:
    -   Ability Score Increases (ASIs) or Feats (at levels 4, 8, 12, etc.).
    -   New class or subclass features.
    -   Increased spell slots or new spells known/prepared.
    -   Skill or tool proficiency choices.
    -   Subclass selection (if you reach the level your class gains its subclass, e.g., level 3 for many classes).
4.  **Complete Prompts:** Carefully read and complete all Advancement prompts presented.

**Important:** Just like with initial creation, your GM must have the dnd5e system setting "Disable Level Up Automation" **unchecked** for the level-up advancements to work correctly.

Once you have completed all the prompts, your character sheet will be updated to reflect your new level and abilities.
