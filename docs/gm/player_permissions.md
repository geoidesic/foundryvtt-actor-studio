# Player Permissions (GM)

To allow players to use Actor Studio to create their own characters, you need to grant them the necessary permissions within Foundry VTT.

## Required Permission: "Create New Actors"

The core permission required is **"Create New Actors"**. Without this, players cannot initiate the character creation process using Actor Studio or any other method.

## Granting Permissions

1.  Log in to your Foundry VTT world as the Gamemaster.
2.  Navigate to the "Game Settings" tab (cog icon).
3.  Click on "Configure Permissions".
4.  In the permissions grid, find the row corresponding to the player role you want to grant access to (e.g., "Player", "Trusted Player", "Assistant GM").
5.  Find the column labeled **"Create New Actors"**.
6.  Select the desired permission level for that role in the "Create New Actors" column.

## Recommended Role: "Trusted Player"

It is generally recommended to grant the "Create New Actors" permission only to the **"Trusted Player"** role, or potentially "Assistant GM". Assign players whom you trust to create characters appropriately to this role. Granting this permission to the default "Player" role might not be desired in all campaigns.

## How Players Access Actor Studio

Once granted the "Create New Actors" permission, players can typically access Actor Studio in two ways:

1.  **Actors Directory:** By clicking the "Create Actor" button in the Actors sidebar tab. Actor Studio adds an option here.
2.  **Sidebar Button:** Actor Studio may add a dedicated button to the main sidebar tools (this might vary based on module version and configuration).

Ensure your players have the correct permissions assigned to use the tool.
