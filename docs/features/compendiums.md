# Compendiums Feature Overview

## Introduction
The Compendiums feature allows the Dungeon Master (DM) or Game Master (GM) to control which compendiums are accessible to the Actor Studio module. This functionality is crucial for tailoring the available resources and options during the actor creation process.

## Setting Available Compendiums
- The DM/GM can specify which compendiums are available for use within the Actor Studio.
- This setting can be adjusted in the module's configuration options, allowing for flexibility based on the campaign or game setting.

## Implications for Actor Creation
- By limiting the available compendiums, the DM/GM can ensure that players only have access to relevant content, enhancing the thematic consistency of the game.
- This feature helps in managing the complexity of character creation by focusing on specific resources, making it easier for players to navigate their options.

## User Experience
- When creating an actor, players will see only the races, classes, backgrounds, and other elements that are included in the selected compendiums.
- This streamlined approach aids in reducing confusion and helps players make informed choices based on the available content.

## Conclusion
The Compendiums feature is a vital aspect of the Actor Studio module, providing DMs/GMs with the tools to customize the player experience and maintain control over the resources available during character creation.
