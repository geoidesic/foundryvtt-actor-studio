# Actor Studio Close/Reset Test Results

## Test Summary
Successfully created and validated tests for Actor Studio's close/reset functionality. All 12 tests are passing.

## Test Coverage

### Core Reset Functionality
✅ **Reset from idle state** - Handles reset when already in idle state  
✅ **Reset from creating_character state** - Can close during character creation  
✅ **Reset from processing_advancements state** - Can close during advancement processing  
✅ **Reset from selecting_equipment state** - Can close during equipment selection  
✅ **Reset from selecting_spells state** - Can close during spell selection  
✅ **Reset from shopping state** - Can close during shopping/equipment purchase  
✅ **Reset from completed state** - Can reset after workflow completion  
✅ **Reset from error state** - Can recover from error states  

### Workflow Edge Cases
✅ **Reset during mid-workflow transitions** - Can interrupt workflow at any transition point  
✅ **Error then reset workflow** - Can handle errors and then reset cleanly  
✅ **Reset sets isProcessing to false** - Properly cleans up processing state  
✅ **Complete workflow with multiple resets** - FSM integrity maintained across multiple resets  

## Key Validations

1. **State Machine Integrity**: FSM can transition from any state back to idle using the `reset` event
2. **State Cleanup**: The `isProcessing` store is properly set to `false` on reset
3. **Multiple Resets**: FSM can handle consecutive resets without issues
4. **Error Recovery**: Can reset from error states to recover the workflow
5. **Workflow Interruption**: Can interrupt the workflow at any point in the process

## Technical Implementation

The tests validate that:
- All states in the FSM have a `reset` transition to `idle`
- State entry handlers properly clean up processing flags
- The FSM maintains consistency across state transitions
- Mock implementations accurately reflect the real FSM behavior

## State Transition Coverage

```
Any State → (reset) → idle
```

This ensures users can always close Actor Studio regardless of where they are in the character creation workflow, providing a reliable escape mechanism.

## Files Modified/Created
- `test-actor-studio-close.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite for close/reset functionality
- Fixed mock FSM to properly handle all state transitions
- Validated integration with existing test suite (32 total tests passing)

## Next Steps
The Actor Studio workflow now has robust test coverage for:
- FSM creation and initialization
- Workflow state transitions 
- Spellcaster handling
- Character creation workflow
- Close/reset functionality from any state

All critical workflow paths are now validated with automated tests.
